Grading Rubric (Criterion):

These are essays written by begining level adult ESL students. 
The topic of the essay was:

"Tell us about yourself and your family"

They were expected to write atleast 6 sentences. The essays are
graded according to the following measures/criterion:

(If not enough sentences to measure any of the categories below, give a score of 3)

1. Syntax/Grammar

a) Word order - Is the word order correct?

b) Subject-Verb agreement - agreement with respect to person and number (singular/plural)

c) Verb tense + missing verb or extra verb - is verb tense used correctly? Is a verb missing? (e.g. auxilliary?)

d) Sentence formation - are the sentences formed properly? (i.e. begining and ending properly, 
   are the constituents formed properly? missing words (prepositions, subject, object etc.)?)

2. Discourse/Semantics

a) Is the essay coherent? Does it make sense?

b) Does the essay address the topic?

3. Length of the essay: 

a) Is the length appropriate (atleast 6 sentences required)?
   This is not a strict measure of clearly marked sentences. Instead check the number of clauses formed (attempted).

Essays were graded based on each of the categories. A score of (1-5) was given to each category, with
5 being the highest. The following formula was used to compute the final grade out of 10:

Final Score = (1a + 1b + 1c + 2*1d + 2a + 3*2b + 3a)/10

More weight is given to 2b since it is necessary that they inderstand the question.

Fractions are rounded off to the mid points. For example 3.14 = 3.0, 3.56 = 3.5 and 3.71 = 4.0.
